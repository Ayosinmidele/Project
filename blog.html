<h2> The Humble Beginning of <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Jiraiya">Jiraiya Sensei</a></h2>

			<em>Jiraiya Sensei grew up struggling to become a ninja. His skills were mid and he was overlooked by his collegues. However, he remained very motivated and kept on polishing his skills until he mistakenly summoned the frogs which he wasn't in contract with.</em>
